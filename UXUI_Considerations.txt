UI Components Priority/Hierarchy

User

Non-netrunner, non-blackice (i.e. - other players)

Netrunner - has a user allocation/assignment


Black Ice - has a room assignment

Initiative - tracks other players, netrunner, and black ice constructs

Map

Room - has a map assignment

    considerations: contents are just really a propery of a room whereas the netrunners can move through rooms


Modes

    DM - manage maps and room.
        rezzing/placing black ice and assigning room contents
        taking actions for black ice / demons

    PC - taking actions for themselves - pathfind, cloak, slide, id, backdoor, rez programs (need to think about rezzing black ice)

    All - initiative.  set / move / remove
        considerations:  players can only affect their players - dm can change any

    Layout options
        for DM, architecture management - dedicated UI.

        for gameplay
            initial login (long term use state to auto login)
            pick what resource to be assigned to (netrunner / nonnetrunner / dm) - or add new - dm can remove choices.  might need to have management UI
            see list of all shown resources in list.  their item is editable.  can enter init number or click up and down arrows. 
            on their turn, get list of actions in init window

                runners: all actions from above + complete turn
